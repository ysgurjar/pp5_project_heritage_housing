We concluded that the only difference from \"house_prices_records.csv\" is the absence of SalePrice. For the data cleaning purpose, we are only focusing primary dataset i.e. (house_price_records.csv), because inherited house dataset is (1) irrelavant for EDA and (2) complete and ready to use as it is.\n"

        "- ```BsmtFinType1```has 7.8% missing values. However, ydata detailed profile report shows that it is  correlated with  ```BsmtExposure```. In physical world, \"walkout or garden level walls exposure level\" and \"quality of basement\" are independent. So, perhaps this correlation is just coinsidence. So, we may have to look at other strategies for data impuration, for ex. distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ```BedroomAbvGr```has 6.8% missing values. However, It seems to be highly correlated with ```2ndFlrSF```and ```GrLivArea```. In physical world it does not make sense. Bedroom above ground has no relation with 2nd floor surface area and living area. So, we may have to look at other strategies for data impuration, for ex. distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ```GarageYrBlt```has 5.5% missing values. However, ydata detailed profile report shows that it is  correlated with  ```GarageArea``` , ```SalePrice```and ```YearRemodAdd```. In physical world, it may be possible that with time (GarageYrBlt), larger and larger (or smaller and smaller) garages were built. It is possible that with newer the garage, better the sales price. We can explore these relationships further for missing data imputation. \n",
